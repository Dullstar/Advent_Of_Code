Dullstar's Advent of Code Solution Launcher: C++ Edition

Args:
    [number]: Selects which day to run. If between 2015 and 2021, this will be
        interpreted as a year. If between 1 and 25, this will be interpreted as
        a day. A year must be chosen before days can be selected.
         - example: "Advent_Of_Code 2021 1 2 2020 7 8"
            - runs 2021 days 1 and 2, 2020 days 7 and 8
            
    all (a.k.a. "--all" or "-a"): If no year has been specified, runs all days 
        and generate a report of unimplemented days. If a year has been 
        specified, runs all days from  the currently selected year (this does 
        not generate a report).
         - example: "Advent_Of_Code 2020 all"
            - runs all days from 2020
         - example: "Advent_Of_Code all"
            - runs all days (note: implies --update_report)
        
    --help: Shows this message and terminates the launcher. Overrides all other
        options.
    
    --update_report: Generates an unimplemented days report. This option is
        incompatible with the [number] argument. Has no effect when run with
        --all, as that option will already generate a report. If an existing
        report is found, it will read the days from that report and run those
        days. Otherwise, it is equivalent to --all.
