I'm probably going to redo this template at some point,
and all these files may very well get moved/changed/deleted/etc.

The current compile times are really quite problematic and that needs to be addressed.

Also, when I added a day from 2022 it caused a linker error to appear that resolved itself
when renaming the function despite it following the earlier conventions, and I don't know why.
Need to try to produce a minimal example that causes it.
