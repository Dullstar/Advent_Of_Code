# Dullstar's Advent Of Code Solutions
My solution for the Advent of Code challenges in various languages.

For the year 2020 specifically, some additional languages may be available at https://github.com/Dullstar/Advent-Of-Code-2020 (as well as every day from that year being present in at least one language), as this repository hasn't quite caught up yet (it is planned, however, along with improvements to some of those solutions). Since the directory structure has been revamped from scratch, the old repository is being kept instead of renamed to avoid dead links in 2020's solution sharing threads.

I try to make these solutions easy to follow.
